# Setting up the Google Maps API with Authenticate Me

This is a project built off Authenticate Me that integrates the Google Maps API
to render maps in React with an API key from Google Cloud Services.

This walkthrough will take you through:

1. Getting an API key from Google Cloud Services to use Google Maps
2. Building in your API into the backend of your application
3. Bringing your API key into the frontend via an API route
4. Utilizing your API with the `@react-google-maps/api` package to render a map
   on the page

## Getting an API key

First, let's generate an API key.

To generate a working key, we need to do the following:

1. Create a Google developers project.
2. Enable Maps JavaScript API in that project.
3. Go to credentials to generate an API key.
4. Add the API key to our app.
5. Add billing info to unlock the full set of Maps functionality.

### Create a Google developers project

To get started, first navigate to the [Google Cloud console][gcp-console].

You will need a Google account to be able to log in to the Google Cloud console.

Once you are logged in, click on the `Select a Project` button in the nav bar.
In the newly opened modal, select `New Project`.

Choose a name for your project. You can name it something like `benchbnb`. Leave
the `Location` set to `No organization`. Then, click `Create`.

### Enable Maps JavaScript API

Once you've created your project, make sure you have selected your newly created
project. Then, open the side menu, select `APIs & Services` > `Library`.

Search for and select `Maps JavaScript API`. Now, `Enable` this API for your
project. (Again, be sure you have selected your newly created project when
enabling this API.)

### Generate an API Key

Open the side menu navigation again, and this time, select `APIs & Services` >
`Credentials`.

Then, click `Create credentials` and select the `API key` option.

Once you've generated a new API key, click `Restrict key`. This will take you to
a new page where you can now rename the API key to something more specific (ie.
'BenchBnB Maps Api Key'). You should also restrict your API key so that it can
only call on the `Maps JavaScript API`.

![Restrict API Access][maps-api-4]

In general, we want to follow the [Principle of Least
Privilege][principle-least-privilege] when it comes to managing our API keys and
what it has access to.

### Add API Key to our App

**Quick Note**: It's important to take this upcoming section very seriously!
There have been multiple anecdotes from students who accidentally pushed API
keys to a public GitHub repo. Those keys were then scraped by bad actors who
racked up tens of thousands of dollars in charges using those keys.

With that in mind, let's add our API key to our project!

Any time we add an API key to our project, we want to take precautions to
prevent bad actors from stealing and misusing our keys. In the case of our Maps
API key, because billing is calculated per map load, bad actors might want to
steal your key so that they can load up maps on their own projects.

Because the Maps API key is loaded in the frontend in our HTML, there's actually
not much we can do to prevent the key from being publicly accessible if our web
app is deployed to production. Since you'll most likely be deploying your app
(for example, using Heroku), then it's highly recommended that you protect your
publicly accessible API key by restricting the websites that can use your key.

![How to restrict API key to specific websites][maps-api-5]

To prevent our API key from being pushed to GitHub while still being able to
conveniently use the key locally, we have a couple of options.

The first option is to use React's built-in system to build in environment
variables on build. This does expose the environment variable to bad actors, so
it's best that you restrict where your API key can be used from once you push
you app to production.

The next option, which we'll be using for this walkthrough is to make the API
key an environment variable available in your backend, and to fetch a custom API
route to get that key to the frontend. This way, you can use Google's system to
restrict where your API key can be used from and have backend validations to
make sure the people who are trying to fetch for your API key are actually using
your application.

#### Backend

In the root of your backend, add your Google Maps API key to your `.env` file.
It should now look something like

```plaintext
PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=«db_username»
DB_PASSWORD=«db_password»
DB_DATABASE=«db_database»
DB_HOST=localhost
JWT_SECRET=«secret»
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=604800
MAPS_API_KEY=«maps_api_key»
```

Next, let's configure our `config/index.js` file to match what we've been doing
with our environment variables throughout the Authenticate Me walkthrough. We'll
add a key of `googleMapsAPIKey` to the exported object with a value of the
environment variable we just added.

It should look something like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  // All other keys from Authenticate Me set up
  googleMapsAPIKey: process.env.MAPS_API_KEY,
};
```

Now, we'll create a backend API route to send our API key to the frontend where
it will actually be used. The whole point of putting our key in the backend just
to send it through a route to the frontend is so that we can add middleware to
prevent bad actors from using our key.

In your `backend/routes/api` folder, make a new file `maps.js`, and in your
`backend/routes/api/index.js` file, connect what will be the maps router to the
rest of your backend application.

```js
// backend/routes/api/index.js

// Other imports
const mapsRouter = require('./maps');

router.use('/maps', mapsRouter);

// Other router.use statements and
// Export statement
```

In your `backend/routes/api/maps.js` file, instantiate a new router, export it
at the bottom of the file, and start the framework of a new route for `POST
/api/maps/key`. We're using a POST route because this gives you the option to
send a public key to the backend to encrypt the API key so that it doesn't get
taken in transit from the backend to the frontend. For our example, we won't go
through all of that. The actual endpoint doesn't have to be exactly like the one
in this example, this was just chosen to be specific about what the endpoint
should return. Your code should look something like:

```js
// backend/routes/api/maps.js

const router = require('express').Router();
const { googleMapsAPIKey } = require('../../config');

router.post('/key', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ googleMapsAPIKey });
});

module.exports = router;
```

#### Frontend

In your frontend, install `@react-google-maps/api`. We'll be using this package
to utilize Google Maps in our app. In this example, we'll be using Redux to make
our API key available across our app.

Start by creating a new slice of state. In your `frontend/src/store` folder,
create a new file `maps.js` to store our maps slice of state. In that file, make
a new reducer with a default case and export it as the default export. In your
`frontend/src/store/index.js` file, import that new `mapsReducer` and insert it
into the `rootReducer` as a new slice of state. Upon refreshing your browser,
you should be able to see the `maps` slice of state in your Redux DevTools.

Going back to the `frontend/src/store/maps.js` file, create an action creator
and its corresponding type and case in the reducer. Then, create a thunk creator
that will access our `POST /api/maps/key` route to get the API key from the
backend.

Your code will end up looking something like this:

```js
// frontend/src/store/maps.js
import { csrfFetch } from './csrf';

const LOAD_API_KEY = 'maps/LOAD_API_KEY';

const loadApiKey = (key) => ({
  type: LOAD_API_KEY,
  payload: key,
});

export const getKey = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const res = await csrfFetch('/api/maps/key', {
    method: 'POST',
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  dispatch(loadApiKey(data.googleMapsAPIKey));
};

const initialState = { key: null };

const mapsReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOAD_API_KEY:
      return { key: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default mapsReducer;
```

Now, we can move our focus to creating a component that will house our maps.
For this walkthrough, we're going to create a Maps component. You'll find that
component in `frontend/src/components/Maps/Maps.js`. It'll end up looking
something like

```js
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { GoogleMap, useJsApiLoader } from '@react-google-maps/api';

const containerStyle = {
  width: '400px',
  height: '400px',
};

const center = {
  lat: -3.745,
  lng: -38.523,
};

const Maps = ({ apiKey }) => {
  const { isLoaded } = useJsApiLoader({
    id: 'google-maps-script',
    googleMapsAPIKey: apiKey,
  });

  const [map, setMap] = useState(null);

  const onLoad = useCallback((map) => {
    const bounds = new window.google.maps.LatLngBounds();
    map.fitBounds(bounds);
    setMap(map);
  }, []);

  const onUnmount = useCallback(() => {
    setMap(null);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {isLoaded && (
        <GoogleMap
          mapContainerStyle={containerStyle}
          center={center}
          zoom={10}
          onLoad={onLoad}
          onUnmount={onUnmount}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default React.memo(Maps);
```

You'll notice that we didn't dispatch our thunk in this component, and that's to
avoid an extra render when we haven't received the API key from the backend yet.
We'll be dispatching our thunk in `frontend/src/components/Maps/index.js`.

```js
// frontend/src/components/Maps/index.js
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

import { getKey } from '../../store/maps';
import Maps from './Maps';

const MapContainer = () => {
  const key = useSelector((state) => state.maps.key);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  if (!key) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <Maps apiKey={key} />
  );
};

export default MapContainer;
```

### Add billing info

Finally, in order for our Maps API to work without restrictions, we'll need to
add billing info to our Google account. To do this, open the side navigation
menu again and go to `Billing` to add your credit card info.
